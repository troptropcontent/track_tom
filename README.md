The goal of this project was to get my hands on Nestjs.

The idea was to create a website to help freelancers to track the time they spend on each projects they have. 

The main use case is simple : 

The user choose a project and then toggle a start/stop button to record time spent on the project.

It is a work in progress. 

For now i setup :

- The first tables (users and projects) with typeorm
- An authentification with username/password and jwt between the the backend and the frontend
- The base of a Design-System in the React app.
- Some unit test & integration test on the back end

I am currently working on the usecase : A user want to setup a new project.
